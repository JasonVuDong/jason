    <h2>User Research</h2>

      <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/qJXEHh8.png" alt="User Interview Photo">
      <p class="researchparagraph">I haven’t created a website before so I considered User Interviews
        to be an important part of this project. Going to the interviews, I wanted to know what the
        users want so I can prioritize the important features and eliminate the unnecessary ones. My
        questions were mostly about what the users like/dislike in a website. These questions give me
        a general idea of what the majority of users like to see and dislike to see in a website.
        Besides, I also asked about what feature will impress the user because I think first impression
        is crucial for a website.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

      </div>
      <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/osCBHPB.png" alt="Competitor Analysis Photo">
      <p class="researchparagraph">The main point of Competitor Analysis is to figure out the strengths and weaknesses of other reputable designers/companies,
         so I can utilize those strengths as a guide to my own website. For the competitors, I analyzed both direct and indirect competitors
         that include web design websites and web designer. The reason I analyzed them is because they are capable of producing high quality
         websites and they all have a large audience.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/nps6tH9.png" alt="Feature Value Matrix Photo">
        <p class="researchparagraph">Feature Value Matrix is to list out all the important features that will or will not be implemented. The purpose of if is to
          weigh and compare the features based on User value, Business value, and Development effort, so that I can choose the best possible features that are worth
           implemented. Some of the must-have features are Designer’s Name and Photo, 3 Pages Linked by Navigation, Three Media Queries, Designer’s Projects.
           These are must have features because the site should make the user connected to the website.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

         <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/bnyBZya.png" alt="Feature Prioritization Photo">
         <p class="researchparagraph">In this project, I prioritized more about the content than the technological aspects of the site. The features that have high priority
           are names, photos, social media, and biography because the site is a personal website. The features that have a lower priority are the ones that relate to technological
            aspects such as interactive elements, hover effects, animations.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>

        <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/b0Wqluz.png" alt="User Stories Photo">
        <p class="researchparagraph"> In the process of creating my user stories, I put myself into different people’s perspectives. I tried to build the possible user cases that
          might happen when the users visit my site. I think creating user stories is very important because I can see different perspectives from different people and what their
          goals are when they visit my website. It allows me to have a better understanding of my possible audience.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/Vi2Zo36.png" alt="Cognitive Walkthrough Photo">
        <p class="researchparagraph"> I think Cognitive Walkthrough is the process in which the designer observes how the users interact with the website. It is very important because
          it shows exactly how a user may interact with the website. This process shows the designer if the website is working as intended or not. It can also point out the flaws that
           need to be fixed. In my Cognitive Walkthrough, one challenge is selecting the cases to test, because there are so many sections that I want to test, but I know that the users
           will not be able to do all. Beside, most of my users didn’t give helpful explanation to how they interacted.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

       </div>
         <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/pJpwE3T.png" alt="5 Second Test Photo">
         <p class="researchparagraph"> For the 5 Second Test, I ask the users "What is this website about?" and "Do you like it". The reason I choose these questions is because I want to see how
            quickly the users pay attention and what captures them immediately. For 5 seconds, I don't think I should ask many questions because I don't think the users have enough time.
            One of the challenges is the test 5 Second Test is too quick for some people to even see what the website is about. Based on the results, more people like my website than disliking it in
            the 5 second Test so I’m happy with that. </p>

       </div>
         <img class="researchphoto" src="https://i.imgur.com/LJ2948D.png" alt="Click Test Photo">
         <p class="researchparagraph"> For the Click Test, I ask the users "Why did you click there?". The reason I choose this question is because it is simple and concise. The question goes straight
           to the point of asking why the users did that. I figure that people usually have short focus so I will do the quick and easy tests. One of the challenges is the test is too simple and
           the results don’t show much meaning. Based on the results, many users have the same answer because their task is obvious. People usually click on something that is linkable to somewhere.</p>

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p class="researchparagraph"> In my User Research, my main goal was to explore the ideas and opinions from the general public to select the best possible features to implement in my website.
          Based on the User Interviews and Competitor Analysis, there are many good features that I want to have in my own website. The problem is that my technical skills and time constraint do not
          allow me to have all those features. The Feature Value Matrix and Feature Prioritization allow me to see what is important and what is not, based on that, I can implement the must-have features
          first before doing the less important ones.</p>
        <p class="researchparagraph"> The User Testing allows me to see how the actual user interaction takes place because The User Research is helpful, but it’s not practical. From the testing, I saw many
          flaws in website that I hadn’t seen before. The testings allows me to see how the users really interact with my websites. It shows what the users like and dislike. The feedbacks are very important, as someone
          who wants to be an UX designer, I have to incorporate feedbacks into my product. However, I do think that not all of the user’s opinions are helpful, so I have to really think about what I should change my
          site based on those opinions.</p>

         <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
         <p class="researchparagraph"> Overall, the findings allow me to see from the user’s perspective, and it greatly helps me understand better about my website from both perspective, the designer and the user.
            The difficulty is how to successfully implement the good feedbacks into my site while maintaining the site’s personality. The users pointed out the possible flaws, now it’s my job to evaluate them before
            the final implementation. </p>
          <p class="researchparagraph"> During the User Testing phase, I realized that user experience matters the most in the website. Every website has its flaws and the users are the ones who may point out those flaws.
            However, one challenge is that every user thinks differently, so it’s difficult to incorporate all of their opinions into the website so I have to really think what vital features to have. Based on the findings,
            my website has some flaws such as lack of content, word color choice, and section spacing. After making evaluation and comparing to other students'portfolios, I will incorporate these changes into my final product. </p>
