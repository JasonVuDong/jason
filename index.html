        <p class="biodescription"><strong>Hi! </strong> My name is Jason Dong. I'm an Informatics Undergraduate specialized in Human-Computer Interaction at University of California, Irvine.
          User Experience has always been my interest because I think that having a good user experience is crucial for the success of a design.
          However, many designers overlook this vital aspect of the design because we still see many websites/apps that have bad usability.
          Being an inspired UX designer, my dream is to learn the skills and knowledge to improve the products that we use.</p>
        <p class="biodescription">From my project courses, I have learned to effectively collaborate with other people to solve complex problems. I also enjoy
          working with others because I learn a lot from them. Currently, my goal is to land an internship in UX Research/Design and become an UX designer after graduation.</p>
        <p class="biodescription">Besides school, I love to work out and follow car channels on Youtube. I also enjoy travelling to different places and overcome challenging
          hiking trails in California. My future goal is to travel around Europe.</p>

        <p class="projectdescription">These photos are the mockups of Main Frame. A smart photo frame device
          that can display weather forecast and photos. The device has a sensor that detects nearby objects
          and switches from displaying photos to weather forecast.</p>

        <p class="utestingdescription">As a user tester at <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">
          UserTesting.com</a>, I analyze the user experience of different websites and report the experience
          to the company.</p>

        <p class="iotdescription">As a participant in IoT research study in Informatics Department,
          I monitor and report how the interactions of smart home devices in an everyday basis over time. At the end,
          I had to give my own reflection and evaluation about the interactions with the devices to the research team.</p>
